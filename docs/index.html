            The modification was designed to be easily put together using cheap
            and easily available materials. If you run into issues, you can open

            This is documentation for what is the second major version of this
            project. It was designed to be far more reliable and easy to
            reproduce than the first. I wouldn't have recommend for most people
            who own the piano to try the first version of the project, but with
            some time, I think anyone could reproduce this one quite well.

                The cool part is that the software supports full 25 key
                rollover, so you can press multiple keys at the same time and
                the sound will still be realistic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some keys are a little uneven since I was experimenting with
                switch types, but if you want to make your own, using the same
                switch creation procedure described further down this page
                should result in pretty even keys, as long as you're careful and
                test evenness as you go.

                The code for the user interface is served by the Pi itself. It's
                a web UI that should be accessible over the local network using
                any device with a modern web browser. It's fully open source and
                not dependent on an app store (or even the internet!), so it
                doesn't carry the same risks pertaining to being discountinued,

                You can also use the piano as a very strange game controller.
              </p>
              <p>
                I tested it with Batman: Arkham Knight, since the combat doesn't
                require many potentially uncomfortable button combos. I played a
                single player game because the piano didn't play well with
                anticheat in some multiplayer titles. The latency is not bad,
                and using UDP made it very easy to program. Theoretically, one
                could improve this by reprogramming the protocol in bluetooth,
                but if you're worried about latency, (I hope) you wouldn't use
                this in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can play wirelessly, but it was plugged in when I recorded
                the video since I had been playing for a bit and needed to
                charge the piano.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that I haven't updated the code for the new switch design,
                but you can dig through the git history or get in touch with me
                if for some cursed reason you want to reproduce this.

            <b>Disclaimer:</b> A little technical knowledge is required when
            putting this together - you'll need to know the basics of how a
            Raspberry Pi works, and how to run some simple code. A little
            Googling goes a long way here - these are things that should be
            doable to figure out for someone who was able to put together the
            base set. The procedure should be fairly reproducible with some
            tinkering. That being said, I make no guarantees about your success
            - the result has worked pretty well for me, but that's just a sample
            size of 1. I recommend reading through the information in its
            entirety before you start making your own. Please let me know if it

                - Get a standard sized Raspberry Pi, and make sure that the
                model you get has a wireless adapter (wifi). Other than that,
                the exact model shouldn't matter
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Accompanying Raspbrry Pi stuff</b>
                - Make sure you have a keyboard, mouse, monitor, correct display
                cable, micro SD card, etc. so you can set up the Pi. I'd
                recommend getting a longish power cable, unless you're going
                with the power bank backed piano.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Raspberry Pi jumper wires</b>
                - Make sure at least one side of each wire has a female
                connector so you can connect it to the Pi. We'll be removing the
                Dupont connector thingy at the other end. We'll need 26,
                assuming none break, so get extras.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Copper/Aluminium Tape</b>
                - <i>Important Note</i> - Make sure you buy tape where the
                adhesive side is also conductive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Small Paper Clips</b>
                - <i>Important Note</i> - Make sure their widths are less than
                the width of the thin part of each key (one unit) and that their
                surfaces are conductive. We'll need 25, assuming none break, so
                get extras.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Power Bank</b>
                - <i>Optional</i> - Only required if you want your piano to be
                wireless.

              <li>
                <b>Tweezers</b>
                - <i>Optional</i> - You can make do without these, but they make
                things much easier, and also help remove tape if you're undoing
                mistakes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Continuity Tester</b>
                - <i>Optional</i> - Highly recommended so you can check that
                circuits are closing as expected while you're building the
                switches. Make sure you get one that can check circuits that
                aren't live. Mine was small and quite cheap.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Rubbing Alcohool/Alcohol Wipes</b>
                - <i>Optional</i> - You'll only needs these to remove tape
                residue if you mess something up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>A Wifi Network</b>
                - <i>Optional</i> - May not really be required, but highly
                recommended, at least to set up. See the software section for a
                possible alternative, where the Pi hosts its own network.

              The setup process has been greatly simplified since the first
              version. A lot of items here are not in as much detail as they
              could be, since online tutorials for these steps online will be
              more comprehensive, and if something doesn't work right away,
              Google is your best bet anyway. For each step, you'll very likely
              have to just Google how to do it, but let me know if something
              looks off.

                Run `piano-flask-server.py` using Python - I believe you'll need

                Connect your Raspberry pi to your wifi network, and set it up so
                that it will only boot when a wifi connection is available (I
                believe you can do this from the BIOS). Alternatively, you can
                look up how to get the Pi to host its own wifi network, but I
                haven't tested this.

                Find the local ip address of the Pi - using `ifconfig` should do
                the trick.
              </li>
              <li>
                Navigate to `(the pi's ip address):8080` (ex:
                `192.168.0.13:8080`) in a pc or phone browser that's on the same
                network, as the Pi, and make sure the UI shows up. If it
                doesn't, check that everything is connected to the network
                correctly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up the Pi so that the Python script runs at startup - I

              <li>
                If everything went well, you shouldn't need to change software
                on the Pi anymore, so you can run it headless from now on.

              <b>Room for improvement</b><br />
              The software is far from perfect, and could be improved in many
              ways, most of which would offer much better responsiveness. The
              reason these haven't been done is because I haven't yet been able
              to justify the time commitment, but let me know if you'd be
              interested.

                Porting the old code over - these are non browser based
                solutions, which I don't recommend starting with because of the
                increased setup. That being said, if these were updated for the
                new switch designs, the responsiveness would be much better
                (these are UDP based) and it would allow for functionality such
                as gaming or adding a speaker to the Pi itself.

          <p>
            The key idea behind the design is using copper (or aluminium) tape
            around the base and each key and connecting each key's tape to a
            GPIO output on the Raspbrry Pi to determine whether or not a key is
            pressed by checking whether or not the circuit was closed. This
            design results in keys which feel unchanged from those the original
            set, and hardware that can be built without needing to get a bunch
            of switches or printing a circuit board. In these pictures, I used a
            mix of aluminium and copper tape, but practically, it doesn't
            matter. If your tape is thin, it might tear easily - an easy fix for
            this is just to double up.

            We start by building just the keyboard portion of the Lego set (this
            starts at bag 11 of the instructions) - we'll revisit the rest of
            the set once this is working reliably. If your piano is already
            built, take it apart and lift out the keyboard and power functions
            assemblies so that you can work on the areas in the following
            pictures - it's annoying, but not as tricky as it looks, based on my
            experience. Once that's done, we'll wrap the entire base underneath
            the keys in tape (or the individual plates which are then linked) -
            this will be our ground once we connect it to the Raspberry Pi's
            ground. To do this, connect it using the tape across the bottom of
            the base so you can connect to the Raspberry Pi ground wire on the
            other side (remove the Dupont connector using the tweezers, and wrap
            the tape around the end of the wire). We also add a wire on 25
            separate GPIO pins starting from 2, and an additional wire for
            ground (consult a pin map of your model for this step). We haven't
            yet built the switches, but this is a good time to test out the
            software by manually closing the circuits and making sure the keys
            on the UI light up/produce sound.

            Now we get back to building the piano. Ignore the transparent tape
            on top of the keys in these pictures - these pictures were from the
            old switch design, but the steps from this point on are the same.
            We're going to build the rest of the Piano around the keys. Starting
            from the beginning, we omit the portion where we add the bracket for
            holding the power functions battery box included with the set (since
            we don't need it), but otherwise proceed as usual until step 76.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next pictures show the differences in the next few steps. We use
            the parts from these sets to seal in the wires between the keys and
            the Raspberry Pi, and try to orient it so that the ports are easily
            accessible from the right side panel, (and/or add a battery bank
            here if we want it to be entirely wireless).
