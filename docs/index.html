      This is a modification of the original set so that each individual key is recognized. This makes it fully playable, unlike the original.
      The piano doesn't require an app, is fully wireless, and can either play the music through an internal speaker, or stream it over
      a local network for better sound quality and/or gaming. The outside is indistinguishable from that of the original model, and
      the feel of the keys is unchanged. <a href="https://github.com/mihir0/sampler" target="_blank">The sampler used</a>
      supports full 25-key rollover with realistic sounds for each key. </p>

            <p>In this demo, the sound was being streamed to a soundbar, so the quality
              is quite good. You can also use a smaller internal speaker, but it's not
              likely to sound as nice.
            </p>
            <p>The cool part is that the software supports full 25 key rollover,
              so you can press multiple keys at the same time and the sound will still be
              realistic.</p>
            <p>Some keys are a little uneven since I was experimenting with switch types,

            <p>You can also use the piano as a very strange game controller.
            </p>
            <p>I tested it with Batman: Arkham Knight, since the combat doesn't
              require many potentially uncomfortable button combos. I played a
              single player game because the piano didn't play well with anticheat in some multiplayer titles.
              The latency is not bad, and using UDP made it very easy to program.
              Theoretically, one could improve this by reprogramming the protocol
              in bluetooth, but if you're worried about latency, (I hope) you
              wouldn't use this in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>You can play wirelessly, but it was plugged in when I recorded
              the video since I had been playing for a bit and needed to charge
              my piano. Welcome to 2020.

          when putting this together - you'll need to know the basics of how a Raspberry Pi works, and how to execute
          some simple Python code. The code and diagrams themselves aren't very polished, but the procedure should be fairly
          reproducible with some tinkering. That being said, I make no guarantees about your success - the result
          has worked pretty well for me, but that's just a sample size of 1. I recommend reading through the information in its
          entirety before you start making your own.</div>

          <h4>The Software</h4>
          <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/debkbanerji/lego-pi-ano/tree/master/code" target="_blank">code</a> here.

            The directory contains piano client code that needs to be run on the Raspberry Pi - I recommend setting it up to run on boot
            so that the piano works as expected whenever it's powered on. There are also 2 server files provided - one for the
            piano audio and one for controlling the computer's keyboard for gaming. As always, make sure the dependencies for
            the files are satisfied. For the piano audio, make sure you've set up the sampler submodule correctly and built the sampler
            cython. For the keyboard, you'll need to set up the key bindings within the file. Finally, make sure that the server and
            client are running on the same network and communicating properly before building. It's all in Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to run the audio directly on the Raspberry Pi with a
            small speaker, you can combine the server and client code pretty easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recommend making sure the software is working as expected before you start putting together the hardware (manually connect the GPIO pins
            to test that inputs are being registered correctly), and testing every so often during the build to make sure you haven't broken
            anything.

        <p>The key idea behind the design is using aluminum foil around the base and each
          key and connecting each key's foil to a GPIO output on the Raspbrry Pi to determine
          whether or not a key is pressed by checking whether or not the circuit was broken.
          This design results in keys which feel unchanged from those the original set, and
          hardware that can be built without needing to get a bunch of switches or printing
          a circuit board.
        </p>
        <p>
          We start by building just the keyboard
          portion of the Lego set (this starts at bag 11 of the instructions) - we'll revisit
          the rest of the set once this is working reliably. Once that's done, we'll wrap
          the entire base of it in foil - this will be our ground once we connect it to the
          Raspberry Pi's ground. We also add a male to female wire on 25 separate GPIO pins
          starting from 2, and an additional wire for ground (consult a pin map of your model for this step).
          We haven't yet built the switches, but this is a good time to test out the software by
          manually closing the circuits.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <img class="d-block w-100" src="assets/diagram_3.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>We need to extend the metal surface of each pin so that it can reliably contact
          the base containing the ground. In order to do this, we fold the aluminum foil
          a few times to make it sturdier and then cut it to the correct dimnsions (rough approximation
          in the picture). Then, we fold it in half so that it can wrap around each pin
          and secure it with electrical tape, tightly enough so that the foil makes contact with
          the metal pin. We do this 26 times to create one 'leaf' for each key, and one for ground.
          It's a good idea to check the connections again at this point.</p>
        <p>It's kind of weird, but works well for what we're trying to do. In an ideal
          situation, we'd secure the connections with solder, but I don't own a soldering
          iron, and this solution is significantly easier for most people.

        <p>Once that's done, we tape each leaf to the correct key in sequence, as shown
          in the picture, making sure adjacent contacts don't touch each other.
          It's a good idea to use one layer of tape so that there isn't too much
          resistance between adjacent keys. I found that tape with a matte finish
          worked better for this part than the glossier electrical tape I had been
          using.
        </p>
        <p>It may be valuable to wrap each section of the base individually so that
          you can move the plates and make the keys easier to work with.</p>
        <p>Don't forget to connect the ground wire to the base</p>
        <p>If the keys don't return to rest easily due to the added friction,
          adding a rubber band to each hammer to pull it down over the
          the corresponding key helps a ton.</p>
        <p>Once again, it's a good idea to check the connections before proceeding.</p>

        <p>Now we get back to building the piano. We're going to build the rest of the
          Piano around the keys. Starting from the beginning, we omit the portion
          where we add the bracket for holding the power functions battery box
          included with the set (since we don't need it), but otherwise
          proceed as usual until step 76.</p>
        <p>The next pictures show the differences in the next few steps.
          We use the parts from these sets to seal in the wires between
          the keys and the Raspberry Pi, and try to orient it so that the
          ports are easily accessible from the right side panel, (and/or add a battery
          bank and small speaker here if we want it to be entirely wireless).
